ASCII ART image converter with image editing options and animation compatibility


1. My program is a simple ASCII art generator. It takes an image and converts it to shades of grey firstly.
Then, it converts the image to ASCII symbols. After that program resizes the image to fit the terminal and gives the best quality possible.

2. There are also further options for image editing, such as:
	2.1 Making negative of the image 
	2.2 Mirroring the image
	2.3 Changing the brightness of the image (from -255 to 255)
	2.4 Using different ASCII strings with symbols, of which the image will consist.
	  Users can choose from the default two ones (one is more precise which is default) and also
  	  user can give the custom transition string  
  
  	  
3. Then, there is a possibility of animation. The user gives the images (JPEG or 24-bit BMP).
One can do it by giving the path to the image or by dropping the image to the terminal (at least on Linux). 
Then, program saves them all and give the possibility for the user to specify the delay (between frames) of the animation 
as well as specifying how many loops it should take and what images to include (and their order).


All the User Interface is implemented with the terminal. Every image is displayed in a "new space", so it "clears" the terminal.
Also, to see the higher quality image user just can zoom out of the terminal. The program uses the values of the height and width of the terminal
to give the best quality possible. Or, vice versa, it makes the image smaller to fit the given space.

Also, I tried to sanitize input as much as possible.
